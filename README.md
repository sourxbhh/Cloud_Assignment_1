# Assignment #1 â€“ Docker Containers

This project demonstrates a **two-container stack** using Docker and Docker Compose.  
- **Service 1:** A PostgreSQL database preloaded with sample trip data.  
- **Service 2:** A lightweight Python app that connects to the database, queries trip records, computes statistics, and saves the results to `/out/summary.json`.  

This assignment introduces the fundamentals of multi-container setups, service networking, environment variables, and reproducible workflows.
